# covid19_isr
Covid19 victims in Israel: numbers, ages etc...  
Public information gathered mainly from news site ynet.co.il and rotter.net.  
There is no public central managed info about all victims.  
Some deaths were not published, but only the total updated cumulative number of deaths were posted on media sites.  
So there are might be some errors/missings in my data.  
  
This repository has:  
1) data file in xlsx format  
2) html file with histograms by age groups  
3) R markdown file to build HTML report  
4) Tableau dashboard (in-progress): https://public.tableau.com/shared/5ZPB9M9BG?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link
