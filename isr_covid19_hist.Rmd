There is no official public data about all victims of COVID-19 in Israel.  
Ministry of Health publishes daily summary statistics - number of deaths total and per each hospital.  
But there is no any additional data about victims.  
  
All detailed data I gather is from news web sites: ynet.co.il and rotter.co.il.  
Not all victims were published on media web sites so my data is not complete.  
Also some typo errors might be occured during data collection.  


```{r import data, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

# version 1 - sheet ynet
#df = read.xlsx('corona_deaths_hist_israel.xlsx',sheet='ynet',startRow=3,cols=(0:6))
#df = df[!is.na(df[["date"]]),]
#df["date"] = format(as.Date(df[["date"]], origin="1899-12-30"))
#df[df$sex=="ז", "sex"] = "M"
#df[df$sex=="נ", "sex"] = "W"

# vesrion 2 - sheet 10yr
df = read.xlsx('corona_deaths_hist_israel.xlsx',sheet='10yr',cols=(0:7))
df = df[!is.na(df[["date"]]),]
df["date"] = format(as.Date(df[["date"]], origin="1899-12-30"))
df[df$sex=="m", "sex"] = "M"
df[df$sex=="w", "sex"] = "W"

Some statistics about victims.  
Age:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#summary(df$age)
cat("Number of observations = ",as.character(count(df["age"])),". Officially published number is 172. \n")
cat("Men = ",as.character(sum(df$sex=="M")), "(",as.character(round(sum(df$sex=="M")/count(df["age"])*100,2)),"%)","\n")
cat("Women = ",as.character(sum(df$sex=="W")), "(",as.character(round(sum(df$sex=="W")/count(df["age"])*100,2)),"%)","\n")
cat("Minimum age = ",as.character(min(df$age)),"\n")
cat("Maximum age = ",as.character(max(df$age)),"\n")
cat("Average age = ",as.character(round(mean(df$age),2)),"\n")
cat("Median age = ",as.character(median(df$age)),"\n")
#max(df["age"])
#table(df$sex)
```

Age by sex:
```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
stat1 = 
df %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(mean = mean(age), median = median(age), count = n())
stat1 = data.frame(stat1)
knitr::kable(stat1)
```
  
There is no actual information how many men/women are infected.  
Here is the last deaths per hospital info the Ministry of Health has published:
